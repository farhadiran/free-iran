&body=Madam,%20Sir,%0A%0A
I%20am%20writing%20to%20formally%20draw%20your%20attention%20to%20the%20continued%20employment%20of%20Dr.%20Fatemeh%20(%E2%80%9CFate%E2%80%9D)%20Noohi%20(formerly%20Fatemeh%20Noohi%20Bezanji),%20currently%20serving%20as%20a%20Research%20Scientist%20at%20the%20University%20of%20California,%20San%20Francisco%20(UCSF).%0A%0A
Within%20the%20context%20of%20this%20case,%20publicly%20available%20reporting%20identifies%20Dr.%20Noohi%20as%20a%20member%20of%20the%20Noohi%E2%80%93Khazali%20family%20and%20as%20the%20daughter%20of%20senior%20figures%20associated%20with%20Iran%E2%80%99s%20governing%20and%20medical%20establishment.%20These%20figures%20have%20been%20widely%20reported%20as%20holding%20influential%20leadership%20roles%20within%20state%20institutions%20that%20operate%20under,%20and%20in%20close%20alignment%20with,%20the%20Islamic%20Republic%E2%80%99s%20authoritarian%20system%20of%20governance.%0A%0A
This%20situation%20raises%20serious%20ethical,%20institutional,%20and%20reputational%20concerns.%20When%20a%20publicly%20trusted%20academic%20institution%20provides%20professional%20legitimacy,%20institutional%20protection,%20and%20international%20visibility%20to%20individuals%20with%20direct%20familial%20proximity%20to%20power%20structures%20associated%20with%20repression%20and%20violence,%20it%20risks%20appearing%20indifferent%20to%20grave%20human%20rights%20violations%20and%20dismissive%20of%20the%20communities%20directly%20affected%20by%20them.%0A%0A
It%20is%20important%20to%20emphasise%20that%20this%20matter%20does%20not%20concern%20academic%20freedom%20or%20freedom%20of%20expression.%20Academic%20freedom%20is%20a%20foundational%20principle%20of%20higher%20education;%20however,%20it%20does%20not%20absolve%20institutions%20of%20ethical%20responsibility,%20nor%20does%20it%20require%20universities%20to%20maintain%20employment%20relationships%20that%20undermine%20stated%20commitments%20to%20human%20dignity,%20human%20rights,%20patient%20safety,%20and%20institutional%20integrity.%0A%0A
Independent%20reporting%20by%20international%20media%20and%20human-rights%20organisations%20has%20described%20large-scale%20and%20lethal%20crackdowns%20on%20civilians%20in%20Iran%20in%20recent%20years,%20characterised%20by%20many%20observers%20as%20among%20the%20most%20severe%20episodes%20of%20repression%20in%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20modern%20history.%20In%20this%20broader%20context,%20continued%20institutional%20association%20with%20individuals%20closely%20connected%20by%20blood%20to%20senior%20figures%20within%20that%20system%20presents%20significant%20ethical,%20reputational,%20and%20security%20risks%20for%20publicly%20funded%20universities.%0A%0A
The%20continued%20presence%20of%20Dr.%20Noohi%20in%20a%20sensitive%20research%20environment%20inevitably%20raises%20questions%20regarding%20vetting%20standards,%20disclosure%20obligations,%20and%20the%20safeguards%20in%20place%20to%20prevent%20the%20normalisation%20or%20indirect%20legitimisation%20of%20authoritarian%20power%20structures%20within%20academic%20and%20medical%20institutions.%0A%0A
In%20light%20of%20the%20above,%20we%20formally%20request%20that%20UCSF%20take%20decisive%20institutional%20action,%20including:%0A%0A
%E2%80%A2%20The%20immediate%20removal%20and%20suspension%20of%20Dr.%20Fatemeh%20(%E2%80%9CFate%E2%80%9D)%20Noohi%20pending%20a%20full%20review;%0A
%E2%80%A2%20The%20suspension%20and%20review%20of%20any%20professional%20licences,%20credentials,%20or%20institutional%20authorisations%20associated%20with%20her%20role;%0A
%E2%80%A2%20The%20initiation%20of%20a%20full,%20independent%20ethical,%20reputational,%20and%20security%20review,%20including%20enhanced%20due%20diligence;%0A
%E2%80%A2%20And%20a%20clear%20public%20statement%20reaffirming%20UCSF%E2%80%99s%20commitment%20to%20human%20rights,%20transparency,%20and%20the%20protection%20of%20students,%20patients,%20and%20public%20trust.%0A%0A
Failure%20to%20act%20in%20this%20matter%20would%20risk%20serious%20reputational%20harm%20and%20would%20signal%20a%20troubling%20tolerance%20for%20proximity%20to%20systems%20associated%20with%20repression%20and%20violence.%20Academic%20institutions%20carry%20a%20responsibility%20not%20only%20to%20the%20advancement%20of%20knowledge,%20but%20to%20ethical%20leadership%E2%80%94particularly%20when%20the%20facts%20surrounding%20mass%20human%20rights%20violations%20are%20widely%20reported%20and%20internationally%20recognised.%0A%0A
We%20trust%20that%20the%20university%20will%20treat%20this%20matter%20with%20the%20seriousness%20it%20warrants%20and%20act%20in%20accordance%20with%20its%20stated%20values.%0A%0A
